# font-glyphs

Font-glyphs I use in my projects. Forked from (orangemug)[https://github.com/orangemug/font-glyphs].

### How to use?
Add fonts in ./fonts/ directory and just run the generate.sh script.
You can also configure the shell script if you want.
After that, deploy the results to the github pages and then you have access to your fonts glyphs to use in MapLibre ecosystem.
